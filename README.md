# Advent of Code 2019

I found Rust to be an interesting language, but a 
little lower level than what I wanted to be working with.
Instead, I'm going to finish learning Go first, then move on
to Rust.

So far there's been a lot of bad code written here.

## Log

1/7 - Hit some hilarious misunderstandings so far trying to do this in go. Interpreted the Day 6 problem as a tree... but it was a graph problem. Ran into a brutal misunderstanding about how slices share underyling data with arrays. Kind of forgot everything there is about actually using pointers.
